The Success Tales

From o to CEO in 3 Just Years!

Meet Andre. He attended Leads in 2019. In one year, he completed his Network Engineer Training and we got him placed in The Coocoo Bird Connect, a flourishing startup based In Bengaluru and serving clients across 20 countries.

Armed with his training from Leads as well as his own exuberance, Andre climbed up the corporate ladder and is now the CEO.

We are rooting for you buddy! Chase even bigger heights!
Love,
Team Leads
